# Audio-Player-Application
- A responsive audio application program called MyAudio
- The MyAudio app stores and manages audio content of various types (e.g. Songs, Audio Books) in a library & the audio content   can be downloaded from a simulated online store (from a text file called "store.txt")                                       
- The audio content in the library can be played (i.e. in this app, playing a song means printing its lyrics)
- Playlists can be created from the library content & store a mixture of different types of audio content
- It implements many ascepts of Java, such as, objects & classes, inheritance, polymorphism, comparable & comparator             interface, collections, file I/O, and exceptions
